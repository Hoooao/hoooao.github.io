Hi!

My name is Xiyu Hao. I am currently a Master's student majoring Computer Science at New York University. I am advised by [Prof.Anirudh Sivaraman](https://anirudhsk.github.io/).

I am interested in Distributed Systems (engineering and theory), PL, and Formal Methods in general. Currently, I am working on [P4](https://p4.org/) enhancement, and [BFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault) optimization.

I obtained my Bachalor's degree from NYU as well.
